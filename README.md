# PROJECT_5_TRAILS
React Trails side project

## Brief

Following on from GA Web Development Immersive course, I wanted to create what I originally envisioned for Project 2 in a MERN stack application.  This was to create a London centric application for runners to login via their strava account and track their Run Every Borough (REB) challenge. Given the timeframe and limited knowledge at the time of project 2 on the course, I simplified the resource to trail running shoes to satisfy the brief.

Outline plan:

- Build a full-stack MERN application
- 3 resources to build around; Run Every Borough (REB), London Trails and Running shoes
